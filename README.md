# Battlefield Portal Utils

This repository hosts and maintains custom libraries, tools, examples, and documentation for use with Battlefield 6's Portal. Whether you're building a new Portal experience or enhancing an existing one, these utilities aim to simplify common development tasks and provide robust, well-tested solutions for UI creation, debugging, and more.

## Contents

This repository is organized into focused modules, each addressing specific development needs:

- **[Logger Module](./logger/)** – A powerful logging system that displays runtime text directly on-screen, solving Battlefield Portal's debugging limitations. Works on all platforms, including console builds.

- **[UI Helper Module](./ui/)** – Object-oriented TypeScript wrappers around Battlefield Portal's UI APIs, providing strongly typed helpers, convenient defaults, and ergonomic interfaces for building complex HUDs, panels, and interactive buttons.

- **[Type Definitions](./mod/)** – Complete TypeScript type declarations for Battlefield Portal's `mod` namespace, essential for type-safe development. Additonal unofficial comments and documentation are added.

## Getting Started

Each module includes its own comprehensive README with:
- Prerequisites and setup instructions
- Usage examples and code snippets
- Complete API reference documentation
- Best practices and common patterns
